# monopoly

## C# code using all the OOP concepts.

The rules are the same as the standard monopoly game:

- The board consists of a number of fields (cities, train stations, chances, etc).
- The game starts by all players having the same amount of money, waiting at the GO field
- Each player gets a turn and buys properties by their listed prices.
- If a player arrives at another player's property, they have to pay the rent.
- The game ends when one player remains the only one with money
